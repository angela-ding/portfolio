# My Portfolio

This site is deployed at: http://angelading.studio/

This is a project to showcase my portfolio and to practice using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This is strictly a front-end project.

## What I Learned:
* Using HTML and CSS to create the webpage layout and styling
* Using Bootstrap 4 to create animations and styling on the webpage
* Using styling and CSS to make the webpage responsive
